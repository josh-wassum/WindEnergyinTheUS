# Overview

I wrote software using the ArcGIS geo-location framework to create view of all wind energy power plants across the US. The app is used just by simply loading the html page within a web browser. Once there the map will populate with relevant data. You can then zoom into a power plant, select it and read relevant information about the plant and it's production. The data was obtained from Kaggle.com and is open source. The source gathers power plant information from power plants across the country for the year 2020.

My purpose in writing this software was to show my ability to show data using a interactive map. Being able to interactively visualize data adds a lot of power and this application allows you to do just that.
